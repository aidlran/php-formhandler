> PHP form validation

## About

This is a form validation module that I use in multiple projects to keep things consistent.

This public repo is **usually not** the latest version, however I figured I would keep a somewhat more stable and tested
version here just in case.

## Usage

- Use **PHP 8.0**
- Include FormHandler.php in your PHP file.

## Plans

- Break up into smaller methods that can be called individually.
- Add more data types.
- Add more validation checks and parameters.
- Consider validating non-POST stuff ($_GET, $_FILE?).
